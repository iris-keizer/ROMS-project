http://www.ecmwf.int/en/research/climate-reanalysis/era-interim

Necessary variables:

Analysis at 0, 6, 12, 18 hours:
Mean Sea Level Pressure (msl)
Total Cloud Cover (TCC)
10m U wind (u10)
10m V wind (w10)
2m temperature (t2m)
2m dew point (d2m)

Forcast step 12 at 0h and 12h:
Surface net solar radiation (ssr)
Total precipitation (tp)

Select an area:
